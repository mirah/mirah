This example set is all the code for Mirah from the Rosetta Code wiki
(http://rosettacode.org/. 

This code is the canonical source for the wiki. Please add as many more 
samples as you'd like. Either add the sample here and send a pull request
to the project owners, or add a sample to the Rosetta Code wiki and send
a message to the project owners. Either way, we'd like to try and keep
the wiki page and this repository synchronized.
